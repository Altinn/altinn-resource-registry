# Testing Resource Registry

Resource Registry provides functionality to register resources with policies. Resource owners use these resources to authorize access to digital services hosted on other platforms. 

We have different approaches to test the various aspects of the Resource Registry.

## Wordlist

ORG - The organization owning the resources. It is responsible for defining the resource attributes and policy
policy. An authorization policy defines who can perform operations on the resource. This is done through rules in the policy.


## Requirements
